        With the Lark
    </h1>
    <p>
        Night is for sorrow and dawn is for joy,<br>
        Chasing the troubles that fret and annoy;<br>
        Darkness for sighing and daylight for song,--<br>
        Cheery and chaste the strain, heartfelt and strong.<br>
        All the night through, though I moan in the dark,<br>
        I wake in the morning to sing with the lark.
    </p>
